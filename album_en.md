### INTRODUCTION
What lies before you is not just a collection of caricatures. It is an anatomical cross-section of the Putin era: Orthodox military Putinism as a form of collective madness.
Here you will find icons with pagan gods, baptisms in trenches, holy water — administered intramuscularly. Here patriotism comes with a sock on the genitals, and the Pentagon’s combat dolphins swim freely.
In these miniatures, society appears as one where war has replaced common sense, “traditional values” have replaced conscience, and Orthodoxy has become the “lubricant” for missile launchers. Priests bless violence, deputies trade in patriotism, and schools teach not to think, but to give birth and obey.

## ZERO-1. NOBEL CAPERS

![](Images/En_Album_001.jpg)

An American bar.
President Putin and President Trump are sitting at a table, drinking beer...

**Trump**:
— Vova, after you took care of Navalny, your political scene is a total cakewalk. Smooth sailing. God's in his heaven, all's right with the world.

**Putin**:
— Don't be naive. Navalny was a nobody. All talk, no action. A glorified blogger.

**Trump**:
— Then why'd you have to wipe his whole organization off the map? For a nobody?

**Putin**:
— Donny, use your head. The man had no platform. Just a bunch of kids in the streets chanting curses at me. Is that a policy? Look at Lenin — now *that* was an agenda: factories for the workers, land for the peasants. This clown? Just insults. It's... tasteless.

**Trump**:
— Yeah, stupid. A real amateur.

**Putin**:
— Precisely. In my entire career, only one man ever truly worried me — Boris Nemtsov. A real politician. Knew what he was doing.

**Trump**:
— So you had him whacked so he wouldn't run?

**Putin** (scoffs):
—  No. We wouldn't have let him run anyway — the election commission would've seen to that. And for the record, I didn't give that order.

**Trump**:
— But come on, Vova. Everyone knows it was your security guys.

**Putin**:
— We don't do messy public spectacles anymore. That's last century's playbook. Why the drama and the headlines when you can make anyone... disappear? Quietly. Neatly. Anyone. Even a U.S. President.

**Trump** (shifting uncomfortably):
— Whoa, Vova, that's not my war! That's all on Biden. And you know I'm your friend. You know that.

**Putin** (slow, knowing smile):
—  Yes, yes. I know. I see you twisting in the wind, playing both sides.

**Trump** (defensively):
— Vova, I swear on my life, I got nothing against you personally. Hell, I even get where you're coming from. I just... I want that Nobel!

**Putin** (musing aloud):
— A perfectly understandable ambition. I've been thinking... why shouldn't I have one? Next year, perhaps.

**Trump** (eyes popping):
— You?!

**Putin** (condescendingly):
—  Donny, everyone has a price. Some are just cheaper than others. And if that doesn't work... well, there are other levers. Threats, kompromat, blackmail... The machine is very, very efficient.

(A heavy pause hangs in the air)

**Putin** (with a dark, ironic smile):
— You know, a Nobel would look even better on my chest than on yours. Just think of the headline: "War Criminal Putin, Nobel Laureate." That is the ultimate power move. It's even cooler than my army at the gates of Paris! That's how you bend this cowardly Europe over and fuck it good and proper!

**Trump** (nervously):
— Hey, Vova, how about... I get the Nobel first, then you can do whatever you want with this cowardly Europe. Deal?

**Putin** (waves a dismissive hand):
— Fine. You first, Donny. Besides, I've got to get to Kyiv before I start collecting prizes...

## ZERO-2. DOCTOR AIBOLIT. VERSION 2.0

![](Images/En_Album_002.jpg)

Beneath a tree, so firm and fit,
Sits kindly Doctor Aibolit.
To clerk and cadet, he calls, "Come near,
I'll mend your wounds and banish fear,"
Says kindly Doctor Aibolit.

Then Musa comes, a limping sight,
"A wasp has stung me in a fight!"
Then Portos groans, "I'll tell you what,
A drone has blown my nose right off!"

A girl runs up, her cries are wild,
"My Vasya, oh my precious child!
He trod a path of mine-laid death,
And blew his legs from underneath!
My poor, lame son, in throbbing pain,
He writhes and whimpers once again!"

But Aibolit says, "Have no dread,
Just bring your boy up to my bed!
I'll stitch new legs, strong and complete,
For marching down that mined-up street!"

So in they carried Vasya, pale,
A broken form, a tragic tale.
The doctor sewed with skill and art,
New limbs to play a deadly part.
His girl now dances, spins with glee,
And shouts, "A miracle to see!
Thank you, good Doctor, for your care!"

But hark!—hoofbeats fill the air,
From the east, a rider, Aksakal.
"An urgent note!" he gives the call.
"I cannot stay, I must be quick!"
And then he leaves with cunning trick.

"It calls you forth to Zhmerynka, go!
Our brothers die, their time runs low!"

"Are they wounded?" asks the saint.
"Yes, and covered in filth and taint."

"They burn with fever, drown in tears,
Their bowels clogged with hopeless fears.
If you won't come to make them whole,
We'll dump them in a swampy hole!
For Putin gave his firm command:
On to the Caucasus, make your stand!"
The sun, the sea, the peaks so grand,
"Russian World" needs a saving hand!

That "Russian World", now vast and eternal—
Mud, swamps, and sands in a cycle infernal,
Where the green men's bootprints, deep and profound,
Are stomped into that consecrated ground.

## ZERO-3. PUTIN IN THE HALL OF TWO TRUTHS: THE JUDGMENT OF OSIRIS

![](Images/En_Album_003.jpg)

> A sacred ancient Egyptian temple. Inside, the well-known procedure of the Judgment of the Egyptian god Osiris, as described in the "Book of the Dead," is taking place. Also participating are:
• God Thoth (court secretary, with a clay tablet in his hands)
• God Anubis (forensic expert)
• Goddess Maat (prosecutor)
• 42 Egyptian God-jurors (wearing masks of Hitler, Mussolini, Lenin, Stalin, Beria, Brezhnev, Zhirinovsky, Dracula, the Devil, and other historical figures)
• Putin (the defendant)

> The hall is illuminated by flickering TV screens broadcasting the court proceedings. Putin stands by gigantic apothecary scales; on one scale pan lies a red paper heart with a gilded engraving: "Putin: 86%". The other pan is empty, yet the scales balance each other.

**Osiris**:
— We begin the live broadcast of the most fair trial in the history of the universe! Today, on the Scales of Truth — the fate of the Great Guardian of Traditional Values! But first — a word from our sponsor. Presenting: the elixir of youth "Ambre"!

(Commercial break: the goddess Hathor drinks the potion and instantly becomes 3000 years younger. Voiceover: "Ambre: a sip leading to Eternity.")

**Osiris** (addressing Putin):
— Do you trust this court? Any objections to the judges?

**Putin** (with a slight smile):
— Oh, Your Honor! How could I! The history of Russian-Egyptian relations... We have repeatedly provided aid... Forgiven debts... Built power plants... The Aswan Dam... Complete mutual understanding...

**Osiris**:
— Of course. We remember. The court will now retire to the deliberation room.

(Everyone remains seated, as they were.)

**Maat**:
— I object! You are violating procedure! The defendant has not yet recited the 42 declarations of innocence before the jurors: I have not killed, not stolen, not lied, not falsified weights and measures... and so on.

**Osiris** (reluctantly):
— Hmm... Very well. Defendant, tell us your autobiography.

**Putin**:
— Gladly, Your Honor.
I was born an ordinary Petersburg kid — an average C student. And through my own persistent labor, reaping the rewards in the field of state service, I climbed to the pinnacle of power — became president of a great country. I pursued the most humane and just policies. In my decrees, I promised every citizen a separate apartment, free healthcare and education, high wages, and zero inflation. I established lasting peace in the warlike Chechen Republic. I became the world's most generous donor. I built 20 oil and gas pipelines. My gas lights and heats the entire planet. I aid national liberation movements worldwide — supplying them with weapons at discounted prices. I distribute billion-dollar loans to poor countries and annul their debts a couple of years later. I give China my natural resources for a pittance. Thanks to my policies, the NATO bloc has significantly expanded its borders. I liberated the fraternal Ukrainian people from the tyranny of Zelenskyy's fascist regime. I stopped the bloody slaughter in Ukraine.

(An ad pops up on the screen: "Gas for every tomb!")

**Putin** (looks at the screen for a second, then continues with his statement):
— I launched the first man into space. My court composer wrote the immortal masterpiece "Swan Lake" [performs a few ballet steps to Tchaikovsky's music]. Finally, I rid the world of Hitler and his fascist dictatorship.
I toiled like a galley slave in the post of President for 50 years! I served a life sentence!
I lifted my country from its knees. I sold the factories to the workers and the land to the peasants. I created the world's number one army.
I extended a helping hand and protected Russian-speaking compatriots abroad from arbitrary treatment: in the Baltics, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. We safeguard the rights and freedoms of Russian diasporas across the entire former USSR.
Life expectancy in the country increased dramatically: I lived to be 98 years old.
Medicine is developing at a rapid pace: I died not from illness, but from boredom.
The patriotism of the younger generation is off the charts: my portrait hangs in every school classroom. Traditional values are taking root deep. We only have two-sex marriages. Divorces, abortions, condoms —  banned. Lesbians and gays — stripped of citizenship. Opponents and critics of the government — all in prison. On Earth, peace; among men — complete loyalty. Is this not an idyll? I have established an eternal celebration of life in my country.

**Osiris** (smiling broadly):
— Enough. You are the quintessence of virtue. The court will now retire to the deliberation room.

(Everyone remains seated.)

**Maat** (angrily):
— Wait! You are violating procedure again... The prosecution has not yet had its say!

**Osiris**:
— Dear Maat, all in due time. A time to gather stones, a time to listen to fables. When it's time for your fantasies [suddenly shouting], I will tell you! The court will now retire to the deliberation room!

(Everyone remains seated.)

**Osiris** (after a pause):
— Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please vote...

**Maat** (jumping up, brandishing her feathers):
— I object! The prosecution's case has not been heard! The weighing of the heart has not been conducted!

**Osiris** (sternly):
— Dear Maat, the defendant's heart was weighed in a special procedure. It has been found lighter than your feather. For it is as pure as the tear of an unborn infant! Anubis!

**Anubis** (producing a pre-prepared protocol from under his robe):
— The scales show zero point zero grams. Innocence is total and absolute.

(The scale pans suddenly begin to oscillate up and down spontaneously. Anubis grabs the pans, trying to balance them.)

**Osiris** (unperturbed):
— It's nothing: perturbations on the Sun. The mechanism appears to be... weather-dependent.

**Putin** (staring into the emptiness above the gods' heads):
— The machinations of Western partners led by NATO. They've even reached the Afterlife. Again, they are encroaching on our spiritual bonds.

**Osiris** (banging his staff on the floor):
— So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, let's vote. Do you confirm the defendant's complete innocence?

**Jurors** (in unison):
— Yes!

**Zhirinovsky**:
— Clone him!

**Brezhnev**:
— Decorate him with an award!

**The Devil**:
— Canonize him!

**Stalin**:
— We are of the same blood!

**Beria**:
— I bow to you, Teacher!

**Mussolini**:
— Pleased to meet you, colleague!

**Dracula**:
— You know how to suck. Our kind of guy!

**Osiris** (ignoring Maat's protests):
— The court announces the verdict:
The defendant is acquitted.

**Maat** (waving a thick stack of photos in the air):
— Are you out of your minds? Here is the evidence! Murders! Abductions! Poisonings! Wars! Hybrid attacks! Falsifications!

(The evidence appears on the screen but almost instantly vanishes. The screen is covered with fine static. A minute later, an image of Putin against the backdrop of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior appears, immediately replaced by the cartoon "Dunno on the Moon".)

**Osiris** (smiling):
— Esteemed gods! Let's vote! All in favor of immortality, glory, and apotheosis for the defendant?

(All 42 gods raise their hands in unison. A commercial is broadcast: "The new 'Pharaoh-Deluxe' sarcophagus! Three colors: black granite, white marble, George ribbon.")

**Thoth** (reading from the clay tablet):
— Approved unanimously! Death is revoked, eternal life is granted! The name "Vladimir Putin" shall be inscribed on the title page of the Book of the Dead in golden ink!

**Putin** (nodding):
— I thank you. This is our shared victory. A special thanks to my faithful dog, Anubis. He's a good boy.

(Anubis wags his tail, embarrassed.)

**Maat** (in despair, dropping her feathers on the floor):
— Inconceivable! Unbelievable! I am filing an appeal with the Martian Intergalactic Court!

(She is dragged away under the arms by attendants with bear heads. The broadcast cuts out. The screen shows dancing Cossacks.)

**Thoth** (closing the case folder):
— Thank you all, you are free to go. The session is closed.

> **Culturological Commentary**
The miniature is based on the ancient Egyptian myth of the Judgment of Osiris. According to the "Book of the Dead," the soul of the deceased was brought into the Hall of Two Truths, where it faced:
—Osiris — god of the underworld, presiding judge.
—Maat — goddess of truth and justice, the standard of purity.
—Anubis — jackal-headed god who conducted the weighing of the heart.
—Thoth — god of wisdom, court scribe.
—42 God-jurors — each responsible for one specific sin; the deceased had to swear before each god that he had not committed that sin.
The main procedure — the weighing of the heart: the heart of the deceased was placed on one scale pan, and the feather of Maat on the other. If the heart was "lighter than the feather," the soul was deemed pure and granted eternal life; if heavier, it faced annihilation. This ritual symbolized absolute justice and the impossibility of deception.

A session of the Russian State Duma. Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin delivers a fiery speech.

Volodin (in solemn tones):
— The foreign-agent scoundrels want to take away from us:
• the Crimean palaces (a symbol of Russia’s greatness!),
• the Donbas mines (long flooded, yet still ours!),
• the beaches of Mariupol (paid for with our blood!),
• the Melitopol cherries (our sacred strategic fruit!).

We shall repel the scoundrels!
Therefore, we adopt the Law on Preventive Confiscation:
• Apartments — for seditious appeals,
• Dachas — for slanderous fabrications,
• Bank accounts — for unpatriotic fantasies.

They have the arrogance to desire — we have the power to confiscate!

## 15. DREAMS OF THE DNIEPER

![](Images/En_Album_15.jpg)

Putin dreams, as though he and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu were fishing on the Dnieper River.

Shoigu:
— The fishing here is excellent... Since time immemorial... Our river, Old Rus’… Mother Volga and Father Dnieper — all the waters of Rus’ came from them… As the great Russian poet once said: “The Dnieper is wondrous in calm weather...”

Putin:
— Indeed. By the way, a thousand years ago, right on this very spot, Prince Vladimir caught a giant Perch weighing over 100 pounds! It’s recorded in The Tale of Bygone Years!

(Putin awakens: drizzle, a nasty gray fog drifting over the Moscow River. He dials Medinsky.)

Putin:
— Vladimir Rostislavovich? Urgently include the Perch in the new history textbook! Yes, that very one… As a symbol… of Russia's… great-power destiny. And make sure it has an illustration!

*V.R. Medinsky is a "history maker" on the Kremlin's order, including for school education.*

General Konashenkov:
— Brief and to the point — as befits a true patriot of Russia. The Russian army does not bomb civilian targets. According to operational intelligence, this was a clandestine workshop producing military uniforms.

Journalist:
— Children died...

General Konashenkov:
— They were practicing how to embroider insignia.

Priest:
— A woman does not need education. So teaches the Church, and so the holy fathers attest.
 A woman’s purpose is to give birth and remain silent. Your only career is obedience and motherhood. And you will receive your reward in Heaven. At our most recent Council, the bishops decreed: "Women’s education comes from the Evil One."

✓ Grigori Rasputin — “Ras-Putin" 
✓ Vladimir Putin — “V. Putin"

**Ras-Putin = Putin I (Proto-Putin)**
**V. Putin = Putin II  (The Sequel)**

> **Curator's Note**
History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. Now it's looping as a psycho-absurdist horror remake. Two different men, one ominous namesake — a recurring curse on the Russian state. The finale, as always, is written in poison, polonium, and palace intrigues.

**Putin I (v. 1.0 — Grigori Rasputin)**
Finale: Cyanide, bullet to the head. (1916)
Status: DISCONTINUED

**Putin II (v. 2.0 — Vladimir Putin)**
Finale (Under Development — Beta Preview):
▸ 30% — Snuffbox Special (Historical Edition)
▸ 30% — Silken Scarf (Classic Strangulation)
▸ 30% — “Novichok™” (Modern & Lethal)
▸ 10% — “Spontaneous” Heart Attack (Plausible Deniability Package)
Scheduled Release: 202X

> **Historical Note**
**Snuffbox** — Emperor Paul I of Russia was killed in 1801: strangled, but the first blow was delivered with a snuffbox.
**Scarf** — Stalin allegedly used a scarf in the killing of his security chief Nikolai Yezhov; “death by scarf” became a symbol of Kremlin strangulations.
**"Novichok"** — a military-grade nerve agent developed in the USSR, used in notorious poisonings such as those of Sergei Skripal and Alexei Navalny.
**Heart attack** — “sudden cardiac arrest” is the most common euphemism in Russian official reports on suspicious political deaths.

Scared the crap outta everyone, and boom — protest’s dead before it’s born.
Had martial law up my sleeve too, just in case. Didn’t even need it.
The opposition? Total losers. Weak as kittens. They were the ones yelling, “Lock us down harder!” Can you believe it?
Pathetic. Everyone just stayed home, shivering over their health.
So yeah, nobody gave a damn about the Constitution anymore.

**Trump**:

Cops and Feds — your bodyguards. Courts — your backup.
And dirt, Donnie, dirt on everybody. No dirt? No problem. You plant it.
That’s how you run the show.

And remember: loyalty, loyalty, loyalty. Then purge, purge, purge.
Show trials — for the spectacle.
And boom, you’re untouchable.

Then you pump your gospel everywhere. Schools, TV, TikTok. “Make America Great Again” — tattoo it on every wall if you have to.

TrEconomics.

Start your own party: TrumParty. Big, loud, orange.

Hell, make your slogan bigger: MAGA — PTAGA.
“Make America Great Again: Prosperity To All. God. Hallelujah!”

**Trump**:

And when they get bored — declare war on Canada.

![](Images/En_Album_52.jpg)

An American bar.
President Putin and President Trump are sitting at a table, drinking beer.

**Trump**:
— Vova, tell me straight: why’d you kill Navalny? Was he really that dangerous to you?

**Putin**:
— Donnie, you’re killing me here!
His numbers were below zero. Why on earth would I fear a guy like that?

**Trump**:
— Then I don’t get it…

**Putin**:
— You have to get it, Donnie.
He bugged me. Drove me nuts. Just hearing his name made my blood pressure spike.
I couldn’t stand living in the same country, breathing the same air.
I gave him the chance to leave — he came back. Why?

**Trump**:
— And then you had him killed?

**Putin**:
— Donnie, don’t be so crude.
I only locked him up.
For financial crimes.
A thief belongs in jail, Donnie. Am I right?

**Trump**:
— Then why did he die?

**Putin**:
— Fifteen chronic illnesses, Donnie. Even herpes. With a list like that, nobody lasts long.

**Trump**:
— That many? But he was still young!

**Putin**:
— That’s what my guys told me, Donnie.
Twenty conditions. Including prostatitis. Same people who worked the Magnitsky case — pros, real pros. My A-team.

**Trump**:
— First I’m hearing about this, Vova. Not even Fox told me!

**Putin**:
— We didn’t know either. But after the autopsy — boom! Twenty-five diseases. Even sciatica. Like some old wreck.

**Trump**:
— Incredible, just incredible. He looked like a healthy guy!

**Putin**:
— Donnie, if you don’t believe me, I’ve got the papers. Certificates, medical files, autopsy reports… all clean. Thirty conditions, Donnie. Including gallstones. He was rotten to the core.

**Trump**:
— Then how the hell did he survive three years in prison?

**Putin**:
— He had nine lives, Donnie. Like a cat. Not even “Novichok” could finish him off. Tough specimen.
Picture it — thirty-five chronic illnesses. Plus lice!
That wasn’t a man, that was a walking corpse!

**Trump**:
— Then why won’t you give back his stuff — documents, tapes — to the widow? If it’s all so clean?

**Putin**:
— Donnie, my guys are worried it’ll land in German hands again. And you know the Germans — they can pull “evidence” out of thin air. We don’t need another "Novichok" fiasco.

**Trump**:
— And why do you keep switching the story? First it was arrhythmia, now poisoning?

**Putin**:
— Local screw-up. Some investigator out in Yamal. Wrote nonsense, couldn’t read between the lines.

(Pause):

**Putin**:
— It was clearly a tragic death caused by a rare frost-related allergy. Entirely natural, nothing suspicious at all.

**Trump** (aside, smirking):
— FSB's Tablets? Commandment #1: Deny the obvious.

(Pause)

**Trump** (to Putin, cheerful):
— Anyway, enough of this sad stuff. Let’s grab a beer for a cheer.

**Putin**:
— To us!

## 53. SUMMIT IN ANCHORAGE, ALASKA

![](Images/En_Album_53.jpg)

A consultation in a psychiatric hospital. In the office at the table — three venerable professors.

**First Professor**:
— The patient claims he is the Messiah.

**Second Professor**:
— What?! The Messiah?! Yesterday he thought he was Hitler!

**Third Professor**:
— Today he has a new mission: “Saving the Ukrainian brotherly people.”

**First Professor**:
— And how does he plan to do that?

**Second Professor**:
— As usual: bombings, killings, kidnappings.

**Third Professor**:
— Paranoid geopolitical delusions with a messiah complex…

**First Professor**:
— Pure lunacy, nothing more.

**Second Professor**:
— Colleagues, let’s avoid lyricism. A specific personality disorder.

**Third Professor**:
— The patient cries, saying: “Ukraine is our pain and tragedy.”

**First Professor**:
— And keeps droning on about some “root causes of the conflict” that “must be eliminated.”

**Second Professor**:
— And every five minutes hysterically shouts: “I want all of Donbas!”

**Third Professor**:
— Otherwise — cheerful, vigorous, active, recently met with this... character… in the red cap…

**First Professor**:
— Ah, the notorious “fireman,” the one who can stop wars with a single glance?

**Second Professor**:
— That’s him. A full 11 seconds shaking hands, then strolling down the red carpet, shamelessly flirting and winking.

**Third Professor**:
— Two of a kind, God forgive me! One raves about Donbas, the other about a Nobel Prize.

**First Professor**:
— Indeed, gentlemen. Vanity is a dangerous thing. It can end in a psycho-political disorder.

**Second Professor**:
— Colleagues! I think we clearly see a conflict of interests. Nothing good will come of this.

**Third Professor**:
— For Ukraine — absolutely.

**First Professor**:
— You’re right. Measures must be taken.

**Second Professor**:
— I suggest a drastic increase of haloperidol. Both oral and intramuscular.

**Third Professor**:
— It would also be advisable to prescribe calming baths of Ukrainian mud, accompanied by recordings of the "Crimea is ours!" chorus.

**First Professor**:
— And why not try electroshock therapy? Works wonders for specific disorders. The Ministry of Health already gave the green light.

**Second Professor** (solemnly):
— The Health Ministry  warns… Misbehave, and you’ll get three thousand volts in the ass.

## 54. WOMB ON STRIKE: VIP MEMBERS ONLY

Sermon in front of a Russian church.

Priest:
— Why do you spill your seed into the toilet? That is a grave sin! The woman's womb is the only vessel blessed by God for your seed!

Man from the crowd: 
— The womb? It's permanently closed. For inventory. VIP members only.

Priest: 
— Do not blaspheme, my son! The womb is not a canned goods warehouse!

Woman from the crowd:  
— "VIP members"? You mean the FSB, don't you?

On a street in a Russian town.

Police Officer:

Man:
— No, please, no fine! I'll cut them off right now!

(Pants down)

Man: 
— Oh! Sorry! I didn't mean to...

Police Officer: 
— Aha! A Ukrainian flag on the ass? Discreditation if... organs!

In the confessional of a Russian church.

Penitent:
— Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned... I am... a paganist.

Priest (alarmed):
— A pacifist?! That borders on treason, my son!

Penitent: 
— No, no! I mean... I am an exhibitionist.

Priest (squinting):  
— A former KGB agent? A spy seeking redemption? The Church welcomes repentant souls.

Penitent (whispering):  
— I am sinful, Father! I... flashed my privates at a garden party...

Priest (beaming):
— You are the Party's rising star?! May your career be long and blessed, my child!

Penitent:  
— I repent, Father! My sin is great! It was... a children's garden party...

Priest:  
— Early exposure to our traditional spiritual values? A brilliant pedagogical method, my son!

## 57. SHITTY IMMORTALITY
Series: *PUTIN – MORE ALIVE THAN ALL THE LIVING*

![](Images/En_Album_57.jpg)

Putin's office in the Kremlin. Seated at the table are: Putin and Mikhail Kovalchuk, an old friend of his, now overseeing research in life extension and slowing aging.

**Putin** (almost affectionately):
– Well, Professor, report: how are things progressing with my immortality?

**Kovalchuk** (enthusiastically):
– There’s progress. Significant. We’re currently working on a project to preserve your... biological materials.

**Putin** (surprised):
– What? What does poop have to do with that?

**Kovalchuk** (hurriedly):
– Hold on. Don’t fuss. Hear me out first.

**Putin** (graciously):
– Speak.

**Kovalchuk**:
– Science has proven that freeze-drying excrement preserves intact DNA. We’ll freeze-dry and preserve your shit and pair it with a stack of photographs and a collection of your speeches. In the distant future, using your DNA and relying on your photos and samples of your public appearances, an exact replica of Vladimir Putin will be recreated. Probably 3D-printed. Well? What do you say?

**Putin** (pensively):
— Shitty immortality. A shitty idea. Say you print me out. But who am I? Nobody. Someone else will be sitting on the throne. They’ll immediately remember the war, the arsons, the bombings, the cables, everything.

**Kovalchuk**:
— I don’t know about that. It’s impossible to predict what political system Russia will have by then.

**Putin** (with emphasis):
— That’s the point. I want a different kind of immortality. I want this — my present body — to serve me forever. Is that so hard?! Heart worn out — transplant. Liver, kidneys — transplant... It's as simple as that!

**Kovalchuk** (cautiously):
– But every organ has a service life – no more than eighty years...

**Putin**:
– Then take a heart from a schoolkid – a recent graduate. What, do you feel sorry for some kid for my sake?

**Kovalchuk** (fervently):
– Not at all! I’d give you my own heart...

**Putin** (disgustedly):
– I don’t want yours. What the hell do I need your rusty junk for? Get me a young heart, with plenty of life left. And in 60 years, put in a new one. What’s so complicated?

**Kovalchuk**:
– At present, medicine can’t guarantee the organ will take. The probability of complications is quite high. So either wait another 20 years, or we preserve the shit.

**Putin** (grumpily):
– Fine, have it your way. Go on with your shit. But only as a backup. In the worst case, after my… death [grimaces as if in pain] it’ll go under the hammer for a million.

**Kovalchuk** (smiling):
– Yes. In the West, the shit of the powerful is highly valued. Some Italian artist, I think his name was Mandzoni, sold his poop for the price of gold. And now a 30-gram can of this shit costs hundreds of thousands of euros.

**Putin** (contemptuously):
– Well, if some lousy Italian shat gold ingots – my shit will go for ten million!

**Kovalchuk** (flatteringly):
– Maybe even more!

**Putin**:
– Only one thing! No greed! 30 grams?! That’s a laughingstock! What am I, a pigeon?

**Kovalchuk** (convincingly):
– You? No. You are a falcon. An eagle. A kite. A pterodactyl.

**Putin** (arrogantly):
– Exactly. And my shit must be of the highest quality. Refined. Deodorized. And make it blue. Blue blood – blue shit.

**Kovalchuk**:
– Of course, of course. First press. Virgin Putin shit. Or Putin virgin shit? Which is correct?

**Putin** (with hatred):
– Dismissed!

## 58. BLESSED ARE THE COPULATORS...

![](Images/En_Album_58.jpg)

The hall of the Russian State Duma. Deputy Valentina Bebienko speaks from the podium:

– Dear deputies! The President has set us the task of reviving great Russia – to triple the birth rate. I won't hide it – the task is not easy. It's a difficult task. A super difficult one. But we are obliged to fulfill it. Because our president wants us to. I propose we approach the problem creatively. Of course, our target audience is young people. Under 30. After 30, influencing their consciousness is not so easy. Mental patterns are already formed, and resistance to the state narrative is observed.

Now let's remember our own sad childhood. How did we satisfy our... needs – the perfectly legitimate urges of puberty? Secretly, stealthily, in dark stairwells on dirty windowsills, in damp basements, on dusty attics, or simply, God forgive me, in the park behind a bush. And always in tension: what if someone sees? What if the neighbors report us? And if, God forbid, you got caught – they drag you to the police, write a report, call your parents. In a word, shame for the rest of your life. This is wrong, comrades. This doesn't agree with the state demographic policy. Let's correct this imbalance. Let's give our children and grandchildren a happy childhood. Just as there used to be a phone booth on every corner – now in its place there will be a beautiful and tidy "reproduction pavilion". With surveillance cameras for facial recognition – we will award participants social bonuses on the "State Services" internet-portal. 
Inside – a spacious room with 4 double beds, a large TV on the wall. A film library with inspiring videotapes and soap operas. A cupboard with Viagra and accessories. Everything is high-style, clean, and attractive – from the cheerful wallpaper  to the playful patterns on the bed linen. And on the steps, instead of a doorman – a priest, sprinkling holy water on those entering, and with a blessing:
"Blessed are the copulators... in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit... in accordance with Presidential Decree No. 666..."

And after nine months, the system will automatically assess performance. If the birth of a child is confirmed, the parents will receive a one-time payment. In case of a male child, the amount will be doubled — in accordance with the state program for the militarization of demographic policy.

## 59. ONE HEAD FOR THE CROWN,  THE OTHER  RULES THE COUNTRY

![](Images/En_Album_59.jpg)

*Note: Illustration blocked by censorship.*

A spacious conference hall. Officials are seated in there. A large, illuminated stage, in the center of which lies on his back a well-known political leader. His genitals are fully exposed; his erect penis is crowned with a miniature, yet precise, copy of his head (the one on his shoulders). The small head of the politician lying on the stage addresses the audience in the hall with a loud, pompous speech:

— The birth rate in the country is falling catastrophically. Like a stone dropped into an abyss. I've been long saying and I repeat: condoms and abortions are to blame for everything! And LGBT. And Childfree. We must fight, fight, and fight again against all this heresy. So far, we are doing poorly.

We banned abortions. So what? Now they go to China to have abortions. Or they give birth in Argentina and stay there for ever. Condoms are the utmost evil. Condoms are a personal insult to me. They violate the basic right of the individual — the right to procreate and multiply. Enshrined in the Constitution, by the way.

We banned condoms having named them  symbols of  extremism. So what? The black market for condoms is thriving. Underground manufactories of rubber technical goods are springing up like mushrooms after rain. All over the country. LGBT propaganda is oozing out of every crack. What is happening? This is a complete failure of my decrees implementation. I will not put up with this attitude.

If the state apparatus cannot force the population to give birth — I will force the state apparatus to give birth.

Switch on your brains, if any.
And start working.

Do we not have a sperm bank? Do we not have an egg bank?
Buy eggs from the population at a fixed price. Introduce a natural tax, for god's sake— one egg per month in favor of the state.

Engage the Academy of Sciences — let them create a state military Incubator. We will raise true patriots of our country. Who from their swaddling clothes will have memorized the military charter and the 10 commandments of Putinism. We will protect them from the pernicious influence of liberal parents. This will be the stronghold of our future prosperity and triumph.
Second. Engage the geneticists. The country does not need idle housewives and thinkers of any kind. The genes of future generations must be the right ones: patriotic, male, warlike.
Is it really so difficult? Get to work.

We will revive our great country and our great "second army of the world." Moreover — we will make it the first!
Whatever the price. Over the corpses of  enemies, through the tears of mothers, across the ravaged land — we will advance without fear and without mercy. We will crush any resistance and utterly destroy all who dare rise against us. Even if it requires bringing the entire country to its knees, we will do it. Make no mistake: the will of the state is iron, and nothing and no one will stop it.

(Stormy, prolonged applause.)
